This repo is a fork of [actigraph.sleepr](https://github.com/dipetkov/actigraph.sleepr). I'm using this package as a base to develop additional features for analyses with Actigraph data. I give no guarantees for this fork, so use at your own risk.

My work is primarily with Actigraph data with non-60s epochs, so modifications have been made (along with new assumptions) for some of the functions. I also do work with physical activity, so I've added some new functions for that.

Most of the stuff here is hack-y code, so use at your own risk.
